## Bibliography
I am Hongting Tsang (曾康庭), a first-year MPhil student in computer science at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology,
very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yangqiu Song](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~yqsong/).

Prior to MPhil, I earned my Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science in HKUST. \\
During my undergraduate years, I had the privilege of working with [Prof. Yangqiu Song](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~yqsong/) and \\
[Prof. Shueng-Han Gary Chan](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~gchan/) by participating in the UROP (Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program).

## Research Interests
My research generally lies in the field of data mining, with a particular focus on reasoning with graph data and its related applicationS:
- Learning state-of-the-art methods and tricks for learning on graphs.
- Its application in Logical Reasoning and other areas.
